## Can classify anything! Any Label, any Language!!

#### Solution to every classification problem!
#### Just put your text (can be any language possible)...
#### And any label you want to classify your text!

### Example:

Suppose we want to analyze this text: "I have a problem with my iphone that needs to be resolved asap!!"

We can assign any label we want, like: *urgent, not urgent, phone, tablet, computer*


Our universal classifier will give a near to perfect solution:

```
urgent: 0.999
phone: 0.995
computer: 0.135
not urgent: 0.001
tablet: 0.000
```

You can put any weirdest text and label, and you will get near to perfect solution for sure!

You can try with 150 languages too! Like this one:

text: "За кого вы голосуете в 2020 году?"
labels: *politique étrangère, Europe, élections, affaires, politique*

model_output: 

```
élections: 0.996
politique: 0.996
politique étrangère: 0.824
Europe: 0.696
affaires: 0.681
```

Maybe your every classification problem can be solved!
